## Summary
This repository was created to keep track of my (Kaif Jeelani, 11th grader) progress in USACO. I primarily program in Python and Java, although I do want to move to C++ in order to be viable in USACO Platinum. I am currently in USACO Silver and wish to get into USACO Gold by April, and then USACO Platinum by December of this year.

## Stats
**Note:** These are rough estimates

Python: 135 problems attempted; 90% completion rate; 85% Bronze problems; 15% Silver problems

Java: 85 problems attempted; 80% completion rate; 7% Bronze problems; 90% Silver problems; 3% Gold problems

Algorithms I Am Strong In:
DFS, BFS, Floodfill, Recursive, Binary Searching, String Processing, Sorting

Algorithms I Am Familiar With:
Tree Algorithms, Prefix Sums, Range Queries, Brute Force, Greedy, Dstraika's, Cyclic Problems, Dynamic Programming

Algorithms I Need To Learn/Practice:
Prim's MST, Binary-Indexed Tree, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm


## Resources
I have been using AlphaStar as a premium resource to practice my algorithmic thinking skills by doing their problem sets tailored towards USACO. I have also been using the USACO guide as well as the MIT textbook for algorithms to learn new algorithms and Hackerrank to practice simple problems relating to them. I also like watching the thought process of Youtubers such as Carrara for additional insight into difficult problems.
